The scope of the library could be defined as follows:

1. Verilog code parser: The library should be able to parse Verilog code and extract the necessary information to create equivalent Python code. This could include parsing module definitions, signal declarations, and function calls.

2. Python code generator: Once the Verilog code has been parsed, the library should generate equivalent Python code. This could involve creating Python classes and methods that correspond to Verilog constructs, and translating Verilog functions and operators to their Python equivalents.

3. High-level synthesis algorithms: In addition to converting Verilog code to Python, the library should also be able to perform high-level synthesis to optimize the Python code. This could include techniques like loop unrolling, pipeline scheduling, and resource sharing.

4. User-defined directives: The library should support user-defined directives to enable customization of the high-level synthesis process. For example, users could specify resource constraints, timing constraints, or power constraints.

5. Error handling: The library should be able to handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to help users debug their Verilog code.

6. Documentation: The library should be well-documented, with clear explanations of each function and method, examples of usage, and tutorials for getting started.

7. Cross-platform compatibility: The library should be compatible with multiple operating systems and Python versions to maximize its usefulness to the community
